# Machine Learning for Image Processing

## Practical Works

- **TP1** (Unsupervised Learning): _PCA_ (_K-PCA_,...) and _ICA_ implementations and analysis.
- **TP2** (Unsupervised Learning): _Non-Negative Matrix Factorization_ (NMF), and _k-means_ algorithm implementation and analysis
- **TP3** (Supervised Learning): _Features computation and choice_ **&** _Linear and Non-Linear classificators training_ (```LDA```, ```QDA```, ```Logistic Regression```, ```KNN```, ```Naive-Bayes```) for emotion recognition based on facial landmarks.
